/*
 üîç Explanation:
 This is a generic async throwing function that performs a network call, validates the response, and decodes the returned JSON into a Swift type.

 It‚Äôs generic, so T can be any type that conforms to Decodable ‚Äî like Post, [Comment], or even String.

 It‚Äôs marked async throws, meaning:

 async: it suspends while waiting for the network call to finish.

 throws: if an error occurs (bad URL, decoding issue, bad status code), it will throw an error to the caller.
